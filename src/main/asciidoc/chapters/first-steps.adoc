== First Steps

[.lead]
The aim of this chapter is to give a general understanding on working with docker by guiding through the process of installing PostgresSQL using docker.

=== Pulling an Image

The image for PostgreSQL can be found on https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres[Docker Hub] and is called `postgres`.

image::postgres.png[title="Postgres on Docker Hub <<dh>>"]

It can be downloaded with the command:

[source,shell]
----
docker pull postgres
----

CAUTION: Anyone can distribute software on Docker Hub. Notice the `DOCKER OFFICIAL IMAGE` badge.

After pulling it can be found in the docker engines image registry by running:

[source,shell]
----
docker image ls
----

TIP: Run `docker --help` to list all possible command. Notice the uniform structure of management commands: `docker [object] [operation]`


=== Running an Image

An image can be run with the following command:
[source,shell]
----
docker run \
  --name some-postgres \ # <1>
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \ # <2>
  -d \ # <3>
  postgres # <4>
----
<1> Human-readable name
<2> The environment variable for the postgres password is set as requested in the reference on https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres[Docker Hub]
<3> Detatched -> postgress should should run in the background
<4> Name of the image pulled earlier

====
Note that Running an image is nothing else than creating a container from an image and starting it afterwards.
`docker run` is a shortcut for executing the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
docker container create --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword postgres
----

[source,shell]
----
docker container start some-postgres
----
====

=== Inspecting a Container

List all containers:
[source,shell]
----
docker ps
----
image::terminal_1.png[]

List the logs of the container:
[source,shell]
----
docker logs bf03c
----
NOTE: *bf03c* indicates the container id *bf03c0ca6cc8*

=== Connecting to a Container

The container is now running in the docker network with its own IP. In order to properly connect to it we have to add a port mapping to the container. A port mapping is a direct wire from a containers port to the host machines port. In this example we want to have a port mapping of _5432:5432_ with the syntax _PORT_HOST:PORT_CONTAINER_, which is essentially forwarding the port 5432.

However we one only add port mappings when creating a new container. Therefore following steps have to be performed:


1. https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/[stop] running container
+
[source,shell]
----
docker stop some-postgres
----

2. https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/commit/[commit] the container
+
[source,shell]
----
docker commit some-postgres some-postgres
----

3. re-run from the commited image
+
[source,shell]
----
docker run -p 5432:5432 -d some-postgres
----

The output of `docker ps` then gives the newly configured port mapping:

image::terminal_2.png[]

*How does it work?*:: `docker commit` commits the container in its current state as an image. This image can then be run again in a new container with a port mapping. This juggling of big software truly shows the power of docker.

The Database is now ready to operate. Client software can now connect to the database and work with it.

Connecting to the database with IntelliJ IDEA:

image::intellij_1.png[pdfwidth=50%]

=== Stopping a Container

[source, shell]
----
docker rm -f some-postgres
----

NOTE: All data inside the database will be lost. If data should be kept longer than a containers lifecycle so called *Volumes* are required. Thes will be discussed in a later section.

=== Result

The advantages of installing PostgresSQL through docker are:

Ease of moving and maintaining the database:: Versions of PostgreSQL can be easily switched by pulling a new versions image. Old versions can be removed cleanly.

Unified installation:: Using Docker the installation is the same on all operating systems. It doesn't require any software dependencies on the host.

Security:: Software should not escape its container.

In fact, all images on Docker Hub can be installed and started just like the walkthrough did with PostgreSQL. Once mastered, installation of software gets as easy as snapping fingers.
